## Core cancer metabolic network
This repository holds the [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/) implementation of the Core Cancer Metabolic Network published by Palsson and coworkers:

[Zielinski et al., (2017) Systems biology analysis of drivers underlying hallmarks of cancer cell metabolism. Sci Reports, 7:41241, doi: 10.1038/srep41241](https://rdcu.be/Olwc)

We have made several changes to the Palsson et al., code, specifically around how the reaction bounds are calculated.
To get started using this model, check out the quick links:
